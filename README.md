this project is built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## development
I fed the app a JSON file (lyrics copied & pasted from [Genius](https://genius.com/albums/Bad-bunny/Yhlqmdlg)). I then built a few functions that count each unique word, check for the most frequent words, and identify the songs those words are featured on. highlighted here are some of my favorites.
